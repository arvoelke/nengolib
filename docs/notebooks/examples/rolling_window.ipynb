    "\n",
    "The following notebook demonstrates use of the `RollingWindow` network, which is a wrapper around `LinearNetwork` that sets `sys=PadeDelay(theta, order=dimensions)` and uses a few extra formulas / tricks. This network allows one to compute nonlinear functions over a finite rolling window of input history. It is most accurate for low-frequency inputs and for low-order nonlinearities. See [1] for details."

    "## 1. Setting up the network\n",
    "\n",
    "We first create a `RollingWindow` network with $\\theta=0.1\\,s$ corresponding to the size of the window in seconds, and pick some number of `LIFRate` neurons (`2000`). The order of the approximation (the dimension of the network's state ensemble) defaults to 6, since this was found to give the best fit to neural \"time cell\" data in rodents.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also need to create an input stimulus. Here, we use a band-limited white noise `process` since these methods are optimal for low-frequency inputs. Next, connect this to the `input` node within the rolling window network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we provide this `process` to the network's constructor to optimize its evaluation points and encoders (during the build phase) for this particular process. Note that we do _not_ fix the seed of the process in order to prevent overfitting, but we do make the process long enough (`10` seconds) for it to generalize. This step is optional, but can dramatically improve the performance. If `process=None` the input should ideally be modelled, or the `eval_points`, (orthogonal) `encoders`, and `radii` should be manually specified."

    "## 2. Decoding functions from the window\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we use the `add_output(...)` method to decode functions from the state ensemble. This method takes a `t` argument specifying the relative time-points of interest, and a `function` argument that specifies the ideal function to be computed along this window of points. The method returns a node which approximates this function from the window of input history.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `t` parameter can either be a single float, or an array of floats in the range $[0, 1]$. The size of `t` corresponds to the length of the window array ${\\bf w}$ passed to your function, and each element of the `t` array corresponds to the normalized delay in time for its respective point from the window. The `function` parameter must then accept a parameter `w` that is sized according to `t`, and should output the desired function from the given window `w`. Decoders will be optimized to approximate this function from the state of the rolling window network.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `add_output(t=0, function=lambda w: w)` approximates a communication channel $f(x(t)) = x(t)$ (_Note_: this effectively undoes the filtering from the synapse!).\n",
    "* `add_output(t=1, function=lambda w: w**2)` approximates the function $f(x(t)) = x(t-\\theta)^2$.\n",
    "* `add_output(t=[.5, 1], function=lambda w: w[1] - w[0])` approximates the function $f(x(t)) = x(t-\\theta) - x(t-\\theta/2)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, `t` will be `1000` points spaced evenly between `0` and `1`. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `add_output(function=np.mean)` approximates the mean of this sampled window.\n",
    "* `add_output(function=np.median)` approximates a [median filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_filter).\n",
    "* `add_output(function=np.max)` approximates the size of the largest peak.\n",
    "* `add_output(function=lambda w: np.argmax(w)/float(len(w)))` approximates how long ago the largest peak occured.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function can also return multiple dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we compute two functions from the same state: (1) a delay of $\\theta$ seconds, and (2) the first four _moments_ of the window."
