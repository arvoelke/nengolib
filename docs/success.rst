Nengolib has been used successfully for several peer-reviewed publications and
self-published projects. We highlight these applications below:

* Ken E. Friedl, Aaron R. Voelker, Angelika Peer, and Chris Eliasmith. "Human-inspired neurorobotic system for classifying surface textures by touch. Robotics and Automation Letters", 1(1):516-523, 01 2016. URL: http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2016.2517213, doi:10.1109/LRA.2016.2517213.
  [`PDF <http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca/files/publications/voelker.2016a.pdf>`_]

  (*) Used nengolib.synapses.HeteroSynapse to improve online tactile classification of surface textures.
* Aaron R. Voelker and Chris Eliasmith, "Improving spiking dynamical networks: Accurate delays, higher-order synapses, and time cells", 2017, Submitted.
  [`Code <https://github.com/arvoelke/delay2017>`_]

  (*) Used nengolib.networks.RollingWindow, nengolib.signal.LinearSystem,
  and nengolib.synapses.ss2sim to model time cell activity in rodents and
  improve the accuracy of dynamical systems in spiking neural networks.
* Travis DeWolf. "Improving neural models by compensating for discrete rather than continuous filter dynamics when simulating on digital systems", 05 2017.
